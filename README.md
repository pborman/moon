# moon
 
The moon package generates images of the moon in different phases.
 
The image can either be a simple two color image or can be a shaded image of the moon itself.
The image of the moon used is found at https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-full-moon-975012/. 
 
The phase of the moon is represented by the numbers [-1.0..1.0].
The absolute value of the phase is the percent the moon is illuminated.
The sign of the phase determins if it is waxing (negative) or waning (positive).
A value of 0 is a new moon while 1 and -1 both are a full moon.
